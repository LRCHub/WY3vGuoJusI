Who's back, who's back?
See a little cat
Run around the flat like "What?"
Man don't wanna get jacked like "Naw"
Naw, it's not that, that
Show up from the back
Swing it in your hat 'til you bleed 'n that, that

Yeah, man's got bars as well, you know

Who's that chick
Might have to bash that brick
In her face
Come out the place

Yeah, obviously it's a little bit basic and that, but
I'm a DJ first, innit?
Like I run tunes and then I spit as well certain times
But, obviously like not everyone was sick, innit?
Remember Wiley?
Remember Wiley used to be a fuckin' shit MC, yeah?
And then he got sick, like that's gonna be me, you know?
I'm gonna start off with a little basic flows
And then man's gonna come hard for you
Watch!
